      <description>What is CX as Code? CX as Code is a configuration tool that allows you to define Genesys Cloud Objects such as Queues, Skills, Users, etc. in plain text files and then apply that configuration across multiple Genesys Cloud CX organizations
 CX as Code Resources CX as Code resources are used to create configuration components using various Input fields as well as data sources (such as division_ID or Queue_Flow_ID)</description>

      <description>What is Terraform Terraform is a tool for building and managing infrastructures. It takes in configuration files, which specify how the resources should be set up and configured. Terraform will generate an execution plan describing what needs to be done to reach the desired state. Terraform then applies the plan and builds the specified infrastructure. When new changes are made to the configuration files, Terraform is able to detect differences and generate incremental execution plans for changes.</description>

      <description>Why use CX as Code? You may be looking at some of the resource articles, or have skipped ahead a few pages in the workshop and asked yourself &amp;ldquo;Why would I go through all of this to simply construct a skill?&amp;rdquo;
While this workshop is intended to provide a foundational knowledge of CX as Code, the scope of CX as Code is well beyond spending 4 hours building a skill.</description>
